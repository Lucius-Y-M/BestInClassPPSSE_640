;A note, INI reader. The settings here work, but divulge significantly from
;vanilla behavior. Additionally, they do not automatically refresh the BIC
;icon when you read a book. I left them here for completeness.

;In the future, this MIGHT become a real setting, HOWEVER until then the mod
;supports a "custom" ini. Simply copy this file, paste it next to the 
;original, and rename it to BestInClassPPSSE_custom.ini

;Any setting in the custom INI will overwrite settings in the original INI.
;This will also preserve them when I inevitably update the mod 50 times.

;If set to 1, unread spell books (that you don't know their respective spell) will be
