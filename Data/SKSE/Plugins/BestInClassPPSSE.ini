;Since the mod ships with its own ini, any update will overwrite your tweaks.
;To prevent this, the mod comes with "custom" ini functionality.
;You can create another ini file, and name it "BestInClassPPSSE_custom.ini" to create a custom ini.

;Custom ini settings always overwrite (valid) ini settings. To get started, simply copy, paste, and
;rename this ini to "BestInClassPPSSE_custom.ini" and simply make your ini changes there.
